# Migrations
The package comes with migrations

## Run migrations
You can run the migrations with the CLI with 
`php composer run migrations`

If you can't use the command line for any reason, you can also access the control panel and run the migrations with a button.
You will find warning when the required tables are not found in the database, and a button to run the migrations by the package.
